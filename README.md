I have pushed some of my projects code here in this repo
Project 1 description:
    Facial Expression Detection using OpenCV and Tensorflow API:
It is a Deep Learning based project where I have created a CNN model with 4 Conv layer and 2 dense layer.After that I have trained the model with 7 types of facial expression and then the trained model is used for facial expression detection.I have used in build OpenCV for face detection and Flask app for interface.Using this model we can detect facial expression from Live vedio streaming too.
